# Forex exchange
sell and buy currency
how: 
since we need to install the mysql server and I'm more familiar with the interceptor in the spring so I take charge of the user info and also the login logout part.
I need to cooporate with the currency info part because we need to update the currecy holdings in the user info. 
login logout user info: user name currency and                                                                   
we use the spring framework to finish the project and from this experience I also learn how to cooperate with others and notice that it's really different with solo project and group project and communication is really important.
