Past Experience
1. Describe
2. What do you learn?

Collabration: when I work as a quality assuarence in my first internship, I need to test the api and check out what went wrong. So I need to communicate with different teams about different issues like: documentation details with masters, development bugs with backend development team and ui issues with front-end team. It's important to have great communication skills so to do the job well.
Detail-oriented: all jobs need to be done carefully because you need to put it to the customers. Expecially when doing the QA job, we need to well design our test case hopefully cover all the details we needed.
Do things with priority: when I was a student, I would like to know all the detail of a knowledge before I work on it. When I work as an assistant, and was aked to develop a webpage, I also try to learn the detail of django and vue first but it turns out there are limited time and I have to quit my plan and rush to complete the job first.
