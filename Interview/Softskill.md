Past Experience
1. Describe
2. What do you learn?

Collabration: when I work as a quality assuarence in my first internship, I need to test the api and check out what went wrong. So I need to communicate with different teams about different issues like: documentation details with masters, development bugs with backend development team and ui issues with front-end team. It's important to have great communication skills so to do the job well.
Detail-oriented: all jobs need to be done carefully because you need to put it to the customers. Expecially when doing the QA job, we need to well design our test case hopefully cover all the details we needed.
Do things with priority: when I was a student, I would like to know all the detail of a knowledge before I work on it. When I work as an assistant, and was aked to develop a webpage, I also try to learn the detail of django and vue first but it turns out there are limited time and I have to quit my plan and rush to complete the job first. 


1. Test

I work as a quality assuarance in the company. Main job is to test the web application that the development team has deploy. I use jmeter to apply http request and check the json result with the documentation. Also we do the ui test, see if the webpage display correctly and the jump between pages. In the end I also develop an automation script on the ui test, using selenium with jmeter's webdriver sampler. As a QA, I need to communicate with different teams, the backend team, frontend team, ui designer and also the master. The communication should be efficient since time is limited. Also, you need to carefully consider all the detail in the documentation, what should be included in the test plan. This is the first time I work in a software development team, I have learn the test procedure, how to use jmeter but most important is I learn collabration and detail-oriented. 

2. Software Assistant
I work as an assistant, my main job is to do the code refactor and also some development. I a web page to display the aggregation result of the data in the database. In order to integrate with the whole project, I use django and vue to develop the webpage. Since this was the first time I develop a web application, at first I was trying to learn the detail implementation of all the tools but this waste me too much time that the time was limited for me to finish. Finally, with the help of my monitor and my effort, I finished the project and they still using my webpage to view the result in the internal meeting. I learn how to develop a web application using python and also some knowledge in html. And that was also a great experience teaching me to give things priority and do arrange your time correctly.
