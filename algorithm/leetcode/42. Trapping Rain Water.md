# 42. Trapping Rain Water
## Description
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

 

Example 1:

Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.


**Actually, this question is similar to the previous largest water container question**
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Notice that you may not slant the container.
Example 1:

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

## Analysis
So I would disscuss both here.
### 1. Largest container problem
In this problem, we just need to find out the largest container. And as we all know, the multiply result only matters with width and height, so we would first focus on the most border one and then we would shrink our border but only those with higher height would matter. 
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int i=0;
        int j=height.length-1;
        int max=0;
        while(i<j)
        {
            int h=Math.min(height[i],height[j]);
            int size=h*(j-i);
            max=Math.max(max,size);
            while(i<height.length&&height[i]<=h)i++;
            while(j>=0&&height[j]<=h)j--;
        }
        return max;
    }
```

### 2. The whole container
In this question, we can focus on each index in the array. Each index would hold the water with the difference with the min(left,right),if both were smaller than currency height, then it cannot contain anything.
```java
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        int len=height.length;
        if(len==0)return 0;
        int[] left=new int[len];
        left[0]=0;
        int[] right=new int[len];
        right[len-1]=0;
        for(int i=1;i<len;i++)
        {
            left[i]=left[i-1]<height[i-1]?height[i-1]:left[i-1];
            right[len-i-1]=right[len-i]<height[len-i]?height[len-i]:right[len-i];
        }
        int res=0;
        for(int i=1;i<len-1;i++)
        {
            int h=Math.min(left[i],right[i])-height[i];
            res+=h>0?h:0;
        }
        return res;
        
    }
}
```
