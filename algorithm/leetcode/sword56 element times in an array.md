# Element Times in An Array
## Problem
### P1
Only one element exists once and others exist twice:
#### Solution
Using XOR

### P2
Only one element exists once and others exist three times
#### Solution
Using bit-wise counting: when the times of the 1 exists in the bit can be divided by 3 then we can say the bit in the target is 0 ohterwise 1;
