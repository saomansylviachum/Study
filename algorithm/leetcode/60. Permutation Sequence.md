# 60. Permutation Sequence
## Description
The set [1, 2, 3, ..., n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:

"123"
"132"
"213"
"231"
"312"
"321"
Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

 (The shorter the question is the harder it will be. Damn.)
 
 ## Analyze
 Because we don't want to do this in the traditional way ( enumerate all the possibilities and count there number untile we got the correct answer)
 So we nee to do this in such way:
 - We can find that in each position it would increase in the order of the number
 - So we would find out on each position which element would we put.
 
 ```java
 class Solution {
    public String getPermutation(int n, int k) {
        int total=1;
        int[] arr=new int[n];
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
        {
            total*=i;
        }
        int cur=total;
        StringBuffer strb=new StringBuffer();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            
            cur=total/(n-i);
            total=cur;
            int pos=(k-1)/cur;
            k=k-pos*cur;
            //System.out.println(pos);
            int count=0;
            int j=0;
            
            for(;j<n;j++)
            {
                if(arr[j]==1)continue;
                else
                {
                    if(count==pos)break;
                    count++;
                }
            }
            strb.append(j+1);
            arr[j]=1;
        }
        return strb.toString();
    }
}
 ```
