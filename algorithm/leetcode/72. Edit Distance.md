# 72. Edit Distance
## Problem
Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character

## Analysis
Let following be the function definition :-

> f(i, j) := minimum cost (or steps) required to convert first i characters of word1 to first j characters of word2

Case 1: word1[i] == word2[j], i.e. the ith the jth character matches.

> f(i, j) = f(i - 1, j - 1)

Case 2: word1[i] != word2[j], then we must either insert, delete or replace, whichever is cheaper

> f(i, j) = 1 + min { f(i, j - 1), f(i - 1, j), f(i - 1, j - 1) }

f(i, j - 1) represents insert operation
f(i - 1, j) represents delete operation
f(i - 1, j - 1) represents replace operation

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int m=word1.length();
        int n=word2.length();
        int[][] dp=new int[m+1][n+1];
        for(int i=0;i<=m;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<=n;j++)
            {
                if(i==0||j==0)
                    dp[i][j]=Math.max(i,j);
                else if(word1.charAt(i-1)==word2.charAt(j-1))
                    dp[i][j]=dp[i-1][j-1];
                else
                {
                    dp[i][j]=Math.min(Math.min(dp[i-1][j-1],dp[i][j-1]),dp[i-1][j])+1;
                }
                
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
```
